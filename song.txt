We sit in the car outside your house
I can feel the heat coming 'round
I go to put my arm around you
And you give me a look like I'm way out of bounds
Well you let out one of your bored sighs
Well lately when I look into your eyes
Down, down, down, down
I'm goin down, down, down, down
I'm goin down, down, down, down
I'm goin down, down, down, down

We get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night
We come home early burning, burning, burning in some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up yeah
Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down
